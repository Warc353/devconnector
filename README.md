Tutorial by Brad Traversy

This is a tutorial and code along by Brad Traversy using the MERN Stack.

I had corrected a bug on my own when I was doing the code while watching the video. I have created this application while watching the tutorial. I did not want to use the gravatar portion of the code but wanted to keep the code in case of future deployment and reference. When I added this code in, it broke a piece of the backend and took me two days to debug what I did wrong. This was a huge accomplishment to me because I broke it and was able to debug something on my own. The issue was due to me not installing gravatar in the backend and I did not take all of the code out causing the backend to not work properly because it was looking for the avatar. This was a huge achievement to me because I was able to fix my own issue.
